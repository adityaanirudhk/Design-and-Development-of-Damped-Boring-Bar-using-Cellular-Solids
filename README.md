Problem: Large length-to-diameter ratios in boring tools cause vibrations (chatter), negatively impacting processing quality and performance.
Solution: Damping is crucial for limiting vibrations, protecting systems operating at high speeds.
Objective: Design and develop a high-damped cellular structure boring bar to replace the conventional solid bar.
Specifications: Analyze factors like thickness (5-10 mm), height (50-100 mm), length (100-200 mm), displacement, stiffness (0.5-2 kN/mm), and mass (1-5 kg).
Outcome: Enhanced machining performance by eliminating vibrations, improving dynamic stability, and enabling boring of smaller diameter holes.
